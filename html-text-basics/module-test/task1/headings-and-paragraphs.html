    <h1>Basic HTML Animals</h1>

    <p>This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.</p>

    <h1>The Llama</h1>

    <p>
      Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a
      web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she goes.

    <h1>The Anaconda</h1>

    <p>
      The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, traveling rapidly by
      way of anchors to sneak up on his prey.
