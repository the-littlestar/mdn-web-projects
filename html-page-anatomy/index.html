    <h1>The Guitar</h1>
    <p>
      I've always been quite facinated by the guitar since i was a child. I
      enjoyed listened to the sounds of the gentle vibrations of the strings and
      2 years ago, <strong>i finally got mine!!</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a gift from my grandmother for my good performance in my external
      exams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever since then, I've been tinkering with it. Though its quite big for my
      stature, and my fingers hurt a lot, i still enjoy playing it very very
      much.
    </p>
    <p>It's a lot harder to play than it looks. hehe, but in trying my best.</p>
