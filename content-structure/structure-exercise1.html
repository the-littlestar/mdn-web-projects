    <h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

    <p>
      This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been
      adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the
      years.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern
      dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <li>
      <ul>
        1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)
      </ul>
      <ul>
        175g of tahini
      </ul>
      <ul>
        6 sundried tomatoes
      </ul>
      <ul>
        Half a red pepper
      </ul>
      <ul>
        A pinch of cayenne pepper
      </ul>
      <ul>
        1 clove of garlic
      </ul>
      <ul>
        A dash of olive oil
      </ul>
    </li>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <li>
      <ul>
        Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely
      </ul>
      <ul>
        Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely
      </ul>
      <ul>
        Add all the ingredients into a food processor
      </ul>
      <ul>
        Process all the ingredients into a paste.
      </ul>
      <ul>
        If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time
      </ul>
      <ul>
        If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time
      </ul>
    </li>
    <p>
      For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of
      lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or
      spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.
    </p>
    <h3>Storage</h3>

    <p>
      Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able
      to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become
      fizzy, you should definitely discard it. Hummus is suitable for freezing;
      you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
